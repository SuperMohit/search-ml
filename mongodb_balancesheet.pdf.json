The GAAP and Non-GAAP net loss per share calculations excludepotentially dilutive shares as the inclusion of such shares would have been anti-dilutive due to the net loss reported.** Non-GAAP financial information for the fiscal 2024 periods is adjusted for an assumed provision for income taxes based on our long-term projectedtax rate of 20%. Due to the expected sustained non-gaap profitability, this adjustment is applied prospectively and comparative periods have not beenadjusted. Due to the differences in the tax treatment of items excluded from non-GAAP earnings, our estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income maydiffer from our GAAP tax rate and from our actual tax liabilities.The following table presents a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAPmeasure, for each of the periods indicated (unaudited, in thousands):Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31,2023 2022 2023 2022Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (25,302) $ (44,671) $ 28,428 $ (33,097)Capital expenditures (635) (2,614) (1,258) (5,152)Principal repayments of finance leases (1,361) (1,287) (2,703) (1,882)Capitalized software =Free cash flow $ (27,298) $ (48,572) $ 24,467 $ (40,131)MONGODB, INC.CUSTOMER COUNT METRICSThe following table presents certain customer count information as of the periods indicated:7/31/2021 10/31/2021 1/31/2022 4/30/2022 7/31/2022 10/31/2022 1/31/2023 4/30/2023 7/31/2023Total Customers (@) 29,000+ 31,000+ 33,000+ 35,200+ 37,000+ 39,100+ 40,800+ 43,100+ 45,000+Direct Sales Customers() 3,600+ 3,900+ 4,400+ 4,800+ 5,400+ 5,900+ 6400+ 6,700+ 6,800+MongoDB Atlas Customers 27,500+ 29,500+ 31,500+ 33,700+ 35,500+ 37,600+ 39,300+ 41,600+ 43,500+"
